    "### 🎯 BUSINESS OBJECTIVE\n",
    "**Primary Goal**: Discover and validate the economic relationships that drive mortgage approval decisions through comprehensive exploratory analysis and HMDA data integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Impact**: Enable stakeholders to:\n",
    "- Understand which economic factors most influence approval rates\n",
    "- Validate expected economic relationships with empirical evidence\n",
    "- Build confidence in the modeling approach through transparent analysis\n",
    "- Identify key drivers for strategic business decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 STRATEGIC CONTEXT: EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS PHILOSOPHY\n",
    "**Critical Insight**: Effective mortgage forecasting requires understanding not just statistical relationships, but the economic logic behind lending decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Framework**:\n",
    "- **Economic Theory Validation**: Test established economic relationships in mortgage lending\n",
    "- **Data-Driven Discovery**: Uncover unexpected patterns and interactions\n",
    "- **Business Context Integration**: Connect statistical findings to real-world lending practices\n",
    "- **Modeling Readiness Assessment**: Ensure data quality for predictive modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 ANALYTICAL APPROACH\n",
    "We'll conduct comprehensive exploratory analysis to validate economic relationships, integrate HMDA data, and prepare the final modeling dataset with full business context."
